This folder contains old scripts that were used for many of the original analyses for the publication. 
These scripts have to be run independently for different types of analyses and only work with a very specific input format
The only reason to keep them here is as a record.
It is not recommended to use these scripts since they are much more cumbersome to work with and yield less flexibility than the new version
